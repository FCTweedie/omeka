# Getting set up with Omeka

Now that you've thought about how to organise your data usefully, it's time to get started with Omeka itself. 

### Signing up
The first step is to sign up for an account. Go to [Omeka.net](omeka.net) and sign up. Choose the free, basic plan, which lets you create one site and gives you 500 MB of storage.

When you sign up, you'll be prompted for a username, password and email address. Once you've supplied these details, you'll be emailed a link to activate your account. 
Clicking the link will take you to a dashboard for your new account. Click on 'Add a site' to start creating your Omeka site.
Give your site a name. It will have the format xxx.omeka.net. You must use alphanumeric characters only - no special characters! Give it a title. The description field is optional.
