# Getting set up with Omeka

Now that you've thought about how to organise your data usefully, it's time to get started with Omeka itself. 

#### Signing up
The first step is to sign up for an account. Go to [Omeka.net](omeka.net) and sign up. Choose the free, basic plan, which lets you create one site and gives you 500 MB of storage.

When you sign up, you'll be prompted for a username, password and email address. Once you've supplied these details, you'll be emailed a link to activate your account. 

Clicking the link will take you to a dashboard for your new account. Click on 'Add a site' to start creating your Omeka site.
Give your site a name. It will have the format [name].omeka.net. You must use alphanumeric characters only - no special characters! Give it a title. The description field is optional. Once you've completed these details, you'll be taken to the dashboard for your account.

You can see how much of your storage you have used, edit your personal information, change your password, upgrade your plan to add more sites or storage, and deactivate your account from the 'My Account' page. For now though, let's get started!

## Adding content
Click on 'manage site' from the dashboard. This will take you to the interface where you can start adding content.

#### Exercise - Add an item
* Add an item to your Omeka
* Describe it with metadata - use both the Dublin Core and Item Type metadata
* Attach a file to your item
* Choose whether it is public or not (items are private by default)
* Choose whether it is a 'featured' item (this means it will be displayed prominently on your site)
* Save by clicking Add Item
 
And that's your first item!

*Please note*

You can add multiple entries for each metadata field by clicking 'Add Input' 

You can add multiple files to an item (but be sure that they really do relate to the same item)

**Item types**

Omeka comes with a number of pre-set Item Types. If none of them is applicable to your collection, you can add a new one by clicking on 'Add an Item Type'

You can customise the Item Type metadata by clicking Edit. From this page, you can add custom comments and new elements. You can also change the order in which the elements appear. Neat, eh?

## Customising

So now you've got an item into Omeka and know how to describe it. It's time to take control of your Omeka! 

Click on the name of your site in the top left of the menu bar to see what the front-end of your site looks like. Omeka comes with a number of pre-set themes, and the default one will be enabled. Now, go back to the dashboard and click on Appearance. You can pick from a few other themes that Omeka offers. 

#### Exercise: Change and customise the theme
* Change the theme
* Add content to your homepage
* Add a navigation link
* Change how your images and data display


Change the theme, then click on 'Configure Theme' for more options.

The 'Themes' tab lets you customise the information that appears on your site, such as adding a logo, footer text, or licence information. If you've selected a *Featured Item* from among your items, you can choose to put it on the homepage of your site. Try changing a few things. If you have the front end view of your Omeka open in another tab, you can hit refresh once you've saved your changes to see how it looks.

The **Navigation** tab will let you change which search options appear on your site. You can add custom links to this section, to direct users to items or collections within your Omeka or to resources elsewhere on the web. Note you need the full url of any external page. You can set any of these Navigation links to be your homepage.

The **Settings** tab will let you customise the size of your images and how they display. You can also choose to hide empty elements, so metadata fields you're not using don't show up.

This will make more sense once you have more content in your site.

#### Users
By default, you're the only user on your Omeka and you have super powers (no, really!), meaning that you have full control of your site. You can choose to add new users if you want to invite a collaborator on your project. You can decide how much control to give them, from Super User, who can do everything, to contributor, who can only view your site without making changes.

#### Plugins
Omeka is highly customisable by means of plugins. You get a few choices with your free account. 
Go to the **Plugins** tab and install the CSV Import and Exhibit Builder plugins
