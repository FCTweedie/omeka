# Getting set up with Omeka

Now that you've thought about how to organise your data usefully, it's time to get started with Omeka itself. 

#### Signing up
The first step is to sign up for an account. Go to [Omeka.net](omeka.net) and sign up. Choose the free, basic plan, which lets you create one site and gives you 500 MB of storage.

When you sign up, you'll be prompted for a username, password and email address. Once you've supplied these details, you'll be emailed a link to activate your account. 

Clicking the link will take you to a dashboard for your new account. Click on 'Add a site' to start creating your Omeka site.
Give your site a name. It will have the format [name].omeka.net. You must use alphanumeric characters only - no special characters! Give it a title. The description field is optional. Once you've completed these details, you'll be taken to the dashboard for your account.

You can see how much of your storage you have used, edit your personal information, change your password, upgrade your plan to add more sites or storage, and deactivate your account from the 'My Account' page. For now though, let's get started!

## Adding content
Click on 'manage site' from the dashboard. This will take you to the interface where you can start adding content.

#### Exercise - Add an item
* Add an item to your Omeka
* Describe it with metadata - use both the Dublin Core and Item Type metadata
* Attach a file to your item
* Choose whether it is public or not (items are private by default)
* Choose whether it is a 'featured' item (this means it will be displayed prominently on your site)
* Save by clicking Add Item
 
And that's your first item!

Please note
You can add multiple entries for each metadata field by clicking 'Add Input' 
You can add multiple files to an item (but be sure that they really do relate to the same item)

Item types
Omeka comes with a number of pre-set Item Types. If none of them is applicable to your collection, you can add a new one by clicking on 'Add an Item Type' 
You can also customise the Item Type metadata by clicking Edit. From this page, you can add custom comments and new elements.
