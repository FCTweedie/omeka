# What is Omeka

Omeka is a content management system and web-publishing system that allows users to organise and share a research collection.
It was particularly designed to help small galleries and museums to share their collections, so it handles images really well.
Omeka is a [Swahili](http://swahili_english.enacademic.com/11461/omeka) word meaning to display goods or wares, and that's what you're doing, when you make items public.

When you create your Omeka site, you should be aware if you're using Omeka's own hosting via [Omeka.net](omeka.net) or whether your institution is hosting its own instance.
If you create a free account at Omeka.net, you'll have less storage and access to fewer customisation options than if you download
Omeka from [Omeka.org](omeka.org) and host it yourself. This workshop will assume that you're using an Omeka.net account.

## Why Omeka?
Lots of researchers, particularly in the Humanities and Social Science (HASS) start organising their research collections in a 
spreadsheet like Excel or in tables in a Word document. Sometimes these will do the job for you, but if you have a large collection,
images, long text descriptions, or want to be able to relate items in multiple ways, these options quickly become problematic. 

**Omeka might be right for you if...**
* You want to organise and display a collection of items (these can be physical objects but can also be places, people, or events)
* You want to manage a lot of information about those items
* You have a lot of text in your fields
* You want to be able to relate your items to each other


**Omeka might not be your best option if...**
* You want a website with text and a few pictures. There are blogging platforms that will probably do this job for you better.
* You want to be able to do complex, custom queries. If you want a lot of sophistication in your queries, you might need a more powerful database
