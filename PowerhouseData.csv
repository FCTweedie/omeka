Before it is turned on, a reel of foil is installed on a timber spool and the end of the foil is fed into a cutting mechanism. Once the machine is on, the foil is fed automatically through the cutter, and rectangles of foil are positioned, one at a time, to receive individual chocolates. Chocolates are fed by hand continuously into a metal ring that rests on a table; there are two rings with the machine, one holding round-based chocolates and the other holding triangular-based chocolates. The ring revolves to present each chocolate in turn to a rod that sits below the table. The rod pushes the chocolate up to the foil, which is wrapped around it. A small set of jaws grabs the wrapped chocolate and feeds it under a foam plastic roller, which gently tamps it to complete the operation. The step-wise action of the machine is controlled by a cam, which actuates a horizontal Geneva wheel.
